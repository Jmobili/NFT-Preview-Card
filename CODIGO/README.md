## My process

IÂ´ve spend 4 hs of (effective) work in this challenge. I think this took me much longer than it should. I wasted a good amount of time re-writting inefficient code, but probably what took me the longest was to figure out how to get the :hover to work.   

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge i learned to make an icon appear on top of an image in hover state.
